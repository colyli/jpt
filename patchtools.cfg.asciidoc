patchtools.cfg(5)
=================

NAME
----
patchtools.cfg - configuration files for patchtools

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`exportpatch(1)` and `fixpatch(1)` read their configuration information from
several files.  The search order is as follows:

* /etc/patch.cfg
* /etc/patch.cfg relative to the Python installation site USER_BASE
* ~/.patch.cfg
* ./patch.cfg

These configuration files specify which repositories to search, which are
considered clones of the upstream "mainline" repository, the user's name, and
the user's email address.

FORMAT
------

Python's ConfigParser uses the 'INI' format.

There are two sections:

* [repositories]
** search:
 ::
A list of paths on the local file system to search for repositories containing a given commit.  The list is specified one entry per line, with leading whitespace to indicate it is a member of the search option.
** mainline:
 ::
A list of paths or URLs that indicate whether a particular repository is considered a clone of the upstream "mainline" repository.  The default canonical reopsitory at git.kernel.org is configured automatically.  This option is really only intended for use if you have a site-wide clone and you clone that locally for your own work rather than pulling directly from kernel.org.
* [contact]
** name: Your Name
 ::
Your name as you'd like it in any added 'Acked-by' or 'Signed-off-by' tag.
** email: space-separated list of email addresses
 ::
A space separated list of email addresses used to commit or send patches upstream.  The list is used to identify whether a relevant 'Acked-by' or 'Signed-off-by' tag is already included in the patch tags.  If no such tag is identified, a new one will be added using the first address in the list.
