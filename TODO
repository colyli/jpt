List of things to do:

- Handle utf-8: see systemd public project, commit 81cf1c43c9a24834433bb5c1f0dc6eb3c1c5b44f, for example

- Allow local config file to add to repo list instead of just replace it

- move project to github

- understand better what each member of Patch class does

- test fixpatch

- automate testing
