fixpatch(1)
===========

NAME
----
fixpatch - a tool to fix already exported patches

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fixpatch* [options] <patch>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *fixpatch* utility is a tool for fixing common issues with patches that
have already been exported from a git repository using `exportpatch(1)`, `git-send-email(1)` or `gitweb(1)` raw commit text functionality.


The behavior of *fixpatch* is controlled by the options below and the
*patchtools.cfg(5)* configuration files.  If no configuration files are
available, *fixpatch* defaults to using the current directory as a
git repository, the email address configured for use with git, and the
user's real name from the system password database.

Unless otherwise specified, default options are to:

* add any missing 'Acked-by' tag
* add a diffstat of the patch between the commit text and the patch content
* rename the patch to a lower-case "safe" version of the patch subject
* detect and use a commit id detected in the patch content to generate a proper 'Git-commit' tag
** 'X-Git-Url' header added by `gitweb(1)`
** Unix-style mbox 'From' (no colon)
* use the 'Git-commit' tag to resolve 'Patch-mainline' and 'Git-repo' tags, if any

TAGS
----

Please see the *TAGS* section in the manual page for `exportpatch(1)` for
descriptions of individual tag contents.

OPTIONS
-------

*--version*::
show program's version number and exit

*-h | --help*::
show help message and exit

Don't add the diffstat to the patch.

Don't rename the patch file.

*-f | --force*::
Overwrite any existing file with the same name.

Only resolve headers ('Patch-mainline', 'Git-repo', etc), don't do Acked-by or diffstat.
